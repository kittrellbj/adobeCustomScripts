# Adobe Custom Scripts
This repository was created to house Adobe Custom Scripts for use on Adobe Acrobat PDF forms. Any time I write something that may be useful to others, I will post them in this general repository.

Naming convention for these scripts will be "primaryFunction.js" (camelcase), and the filename will indicate the primary function or use of the script.

- <strong>average.js</strong> - generates an average of values from the supplied form field values.
- <strong>filenameFromField.js</strong> - allows you to save a form dynamically by taking the value of a form field as the name when saving the form.

If you have an Adobe Custom Script request, you can email me at [kittrellbj@gmail.com](mailto:kittrellbj@gmail.com?subject=AdobeCustomScripts) with a request. If I have time, I will work on it. The rules are: 1) please be as clear as possible with your request, 2) no attachments, and 3) all scripts I produce upon request will be posted here for free for everyone.

Note: I recommend not changing the subject line so your message doesn't get caught in the Spam folder.
