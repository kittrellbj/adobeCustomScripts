# Adobe Custom Scripts
This repository was created to house Adobe Custom Scripts for use on Adobe Acrobat PDF forms. Any time I write something that may be useful to others, I will post them in this general repository.

Naming convention for these scripts will be "primaryFunction.js" (camelcase), and the filename will indicate the primary function or use of the script.

If you have an Adobe Custom Script request, you can email me at [kittrellbj@gmail.com](mailto:kittrellbj@gmail.com?subject=AdobeCustomScripts) with a request. If I have time, I will work on it. The rules are: 1) please be as clear as possible with your request, 2) no attachments, and 3) all scripts I produce upon request will be posted here for free for everyone.
